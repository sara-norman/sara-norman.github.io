            <h5>Brand Evolution</h5>
            <p>To match Breadbox’s encouraging and optimistic approach to learning, the brand evolved into a bright, energetic and lively experience. We created several assets from gamified badges and financial illustrations, to a whole educational platform system with an emphasis on making a system that was easy to scale and maintain. The system of colors and shapes are applicable all the way from thumbnail–art creation to full–blown course graphics.</p>

            <h5>Web Application</h5>
            <p>We were tasked with mapping out the features to achieve the vision and accounting for the technical and strategic implications to ensure the platform encourages learning and growth vs. creating shame and disappointment. The result? A robust WordPress learning platform, using Lifter LMS and a lot of custom features full of intentional gamification, expert-written content and individualized progress tracking and experiences. </p>
